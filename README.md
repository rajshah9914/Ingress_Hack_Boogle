# Boogle

The project aims to provide security over the network and internet. It contains multiple features that tend to provide information privacy.

**Bookmark Save/Search:-** ML , and NLP have made recent trends and would be making an impact in near future. Often found that one loses an essential website. Even though bookmarks are available, searching through a long list of bookmarked websites can be tedious. How efficient it would be if we have a search engine for the same similar to google. Our extension features this service that can be useful for everyone in near future where data is everything.  

**Whatsapp Security:-** AES algorithm provides a double security over the standards. Decryption might take years long. In order to avoid identity theft, whatsapp data that gets stored on server for particular time. According to their privacy policy, they encrypt the data. But, recent times have shown some flaw in their algorithm standards. To avoid these situations, a double security layer is put forth. Again data is more important than monetory components. Losing sensational data may cause loss that are uncomparable. Suppose, your mobile gets stolen, all your data are at risk. App locks are easy to figure out. Your Aadhar card, pan card nos, credit card pins, passwords if shared with anyone are at stake of risks. Look at our demo to figure out how we take on those disadvantages.

**Blacklist:-** You want to block any website that may report cyber frauds, may be install malicious softwares on your system. Kind of phishing attack. Just a button click away to prevent everyone from any occuring frauds.

**Review System:-** Any user can feed reviews for any specific url over world wide web. Other surfers over the network can add informative reviews, claim to watch others'. This gives him/her an insight about the website he is going surf. Might be he is saved from future data leaks. Identity theft, browser tracking, searching patterns leading to obscure your digital signatures considering crackers to identify that you were the one who visited the site.

**Rating System:-** Even before opening any website for reviews, how great it can be if ratings can be displayed along with search managers to get an idea of the site even before opening. There are infinite type of attacks that can be actually prevented.

Background checks are always enabled while surfing, ie. pop-ups , advertisements that can redirect you to phishing links.

# Our only Motive:- "See something wrong, do something right" 

## Build our Project:
1. Fork and Clone the project. 
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Hackdotslash/T17-Tech-Warriors.git 
```
2. Install required dependencies for python3 flask server.
(``` pip install x ```), where x is any dependency that is required.
3. Install required dependencies for node server 
(``` npm install x ```), where x is any dependency that is required.
4. Open two terminals.
5. Run python server -> 
```
cd python-server
python ./api.py
```
6. Run node server using 
```
